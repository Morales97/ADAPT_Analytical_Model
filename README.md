Analytical model to evaluate the performance of the ADAPT Medium Access Control protocol for Wireless THz communications.

### How to run
Run 'analytical_single.m' to evaluate a single configuration in terms of Throughput and Cycle time. Select the desired parameters, most importantly number of nodes, inter-arrival time and CONFIG.

Run 'analytical_all.m' or 'analytical_all_3D.m' to evaluate multiple configurations. Select the desired parameters and ensure that it matches with the parameters in 'analytical_single.m'
